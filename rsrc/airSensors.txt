/* Prologue sensor protocol
 *
 * the sensor sends 36 bits 7 times, before the first packet there is a pulse sent
 * the packets are pwm modulated
 *
 * the data is grouped in 9 nibles
 * [id0] [rid0] [rid1] [data0] [temp0] [temp1] [temp2] [humi0] [humi1]
 *
 * id0 is always 1001,9
 * rid is a random id that is generated when the sensor starts, could include battery status
 * the same batteries often generate the same id
 * data(3) is 0 the battery status, 1 ok, 0 low, first reading always say low
 * data(2) is 1 when the sensor sends a reading when pressing the button on the sensor
 * data(1,0)+1 forms the channel number that can be set by the sensor (1-3)
 * temp is 12 bit signed scaled by 10
 * humi0 is always 1100,c if no humidity sensor is available
 * humi1 is always 1100,c if no humidity sensor is available
 *
 * The sensor can be bought at Clas Ohlson
