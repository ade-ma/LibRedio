This project contains software capable of using a RTLSDR software controllable radio receiver to pick up temperature and humidity readings broadcast from several different types of commercially available wireless environmental sensors.

To build the code, run 'make all'. You will need several supporting software libraries, most notably librtlsdr, available from your distribution's package manage or from [osmocom](http://sdr.osmocom.org/trac/wiki/rtl-sdr), and [rust-msgpack](https://github.com/mneumann/rust-msgpack/).

Documentation and development are ongoing efforts.
