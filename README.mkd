This project contains software capable of using a RTLSDR software controllable radio receiver to pick up temperature and humidity readings broadcast from several different types of commercially available wireless sensors.

To build the code, run 'make all'. You will need several supporting software libraries, most notably librtlsdr, available from your distribution's package manage or from [osmocom](http://sdr.osmocom.org/trac/wiki/rtl-sdr).

Future extensions include improvements to efficiency, a redesign of bitfount to support non-OOK devices, and unification with software for controlling remote outlets using flexible radio hardware.

This software will eventually have a web frontend accepting sensor readings via capnproto serialized announcements over a unix IPC socket and additional code to automate systems using off the shelf electrical devices as cost-effective actuators.

Documentation and development are ongoing efforts.
